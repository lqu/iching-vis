This interactive tool helps you visualize the relations between the Hexagrams. Play and learn [here](https://lqu.github.io/iching-vis/) 
## Features

* Supports drag-n-drop of any Hexagram
* Graph reshapes itself automatically, and keeps all properties
* Color highlight relate Hexagrams (self/selected, adjacent, opposite/negate, reverse)

## Notes
This visualization is to expand the [Hamming Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_space) from 3D to six dimentions, from a cube to a [6-cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-cube) like this.

In the 6-cube representation, 
an edge exists if two nodes have an [Hamming Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) of one, meaning the binary forms differ at only one digit,
e.g. 000000 and 000100.
